#Step 1 create a venv on terminal : python -m venv translator
#Step 2 run it, no need to make step 1 after making it once  : .\translator\Scripts\Activate
#Step 3 modify the translator file to fit your document and style you want
#Step 4 As the translation software and openai api are not compatible i chose to run it in two seperate instacnes
Step 5 in terminal create another venv for flaskapp.py and run that code
Step 6 if you open another terminal window you can run translator from it and it will communicate with the flask application
